Scenario 1:   
One of your students is doing really well in their technical coursework, but you notice that they’re pretty quiet in group meetings and are frequently off camera.   
Scenario 2:   
One of your students is really excited and engaged in their coursework. They participate a lot in your student group and in the classroom, and they’re on top of all of their coursework. You notice that in their excitement, they have a tendency to talk over some of their quieter peers or go on tangents that take up more time than is ideal.   
Scenario 3:   
One of your students is really struggling. You know that their partner works full time and they have a young child at home, and they aren’t taking to the coursework as quickly as some of their peers. You also know that they are frequently multitasking during their lessons or stand-up meetings.   
Scenario 4:   
During Build Week, one of your students is having a tough time with their project group. They share that they’re super frustrated with their peers and don’t even want to put in effort anymore because all their ideas just get shot down. While you know that this student has some legitimate complaints, you’ve also noticed that they have a tendency to get frustrated very quickly with other challenging situations.   
Scenario 5:   
Two of your students just do not get along! It seems like in every standup meeting, one of them says something that grates at the other. While you have a good relationship with both of them separately, and they both get along well with everyone else in the group, at times their conflicts derail standup meetings and make it hard for the rest of the group to stay focused.
