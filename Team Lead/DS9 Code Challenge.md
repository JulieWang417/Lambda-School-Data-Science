@channel Good morning :ds9: :awesome: For today's warmup we would like you to look around for interesting datasets.    
Find something that resonates with you. Once you find it, try to create a new Colab notebook, import Pandas, and then import your CSV file.
Stretch: write a hypothesis based on the dataset.   
Share your findings in your team channel :muscle:
