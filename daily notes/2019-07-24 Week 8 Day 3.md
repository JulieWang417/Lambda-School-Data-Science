@channel Today’s notebook is in the Github repo:   
https://github.com/LambdaSchool/DS-Unit-2-Applied-Modeling/tree/master/module3-hyperparamter-optimization    
You can follow along live with me on Google Colab:

I’m teaching with Colab for your convenience. But I recommend that you work locally today! Hyperparameter optimization & cross-validation with the Caterpillar dataset does work on Colab, but it’s slow.

The Poisson distribution may be useful to model events such as the number of patients arriving in an emergency room between 10 and 11 pm

Poisson distribution  
In probability theory and statistics, the Poisson distribution (French pronunciation: ?[pwas?~]; in English often rendered ), named after French mathematician Siméon Denis Poisson, is a discrete probability distribution that expresses the probability of a given number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time or space if these events occur with a known constant rate and independently of the time since the last event. The Poisson distribution can also be used for the number of events in other specified intervals such as distance, area or volume.

@channel By Friday, July 26, 5pm Pacific, choose your dataset for your personal project, and submit this form with your dataset’s URL:  
https://forms.gle/X1GbH475D5yYKTdr9  
You should probably get this done by end of day Thursday, because you’ll be busy with your Sprint Challenge on Friday. To help the project go smoothly for you, me, and our Team Leads, please submit your form as soon as you can. Thanks so much!
