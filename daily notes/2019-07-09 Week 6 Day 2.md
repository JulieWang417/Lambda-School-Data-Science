@channel you may have seen links posted this morning, there was an *exploit* discovered for *OSx* users of zoom. not the _best_ you can do, but the _least_ you can do if you're an OSx user is

1. look for a setting "automatically turn camera on upon joining", and disable it  
2. be *extra extra extra* careful about opening zoom links. there _is_, in theory, a way for a malicious zoom link to lead to arbitrary malicious code being executed on your machine! but that'd only happen if you _saw_ a meeting being opened  
from zoom themselves:  
```
Of note, because the Zoom client user interface runs in the foreground upon launch, it would be readily apparent to the user that they had unintentionally joined a meeting and they could change their video settings or leave immediately. Also of note, we have no indication that this has ever happened.
```
3. *reinstall zoom over the next day or two*. completely uninstalling it is a good idea.

(and, again, note that this is the _least_ you can do and *not* the _best_ you can do-- some of it gets a little advanced and we don't want to stress people out)
