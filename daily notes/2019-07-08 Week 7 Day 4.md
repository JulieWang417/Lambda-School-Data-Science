@here Today’s lesson includes two new libraries. If you use Google Colab, these are already installed. If you work locally, you will probably want to install them:  

1. mlxtend (http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/) to plot decision regions  
- Local Anaconda: `conda install -c conda-forge mlxtend`  

2. tqdm (https://tqdm.github.io/) for progress bars  
- Local Anaconda: `conda install -c conda-forge tqdm`

If you’ve logged on early and you want to skim some good reads before the lesson, I recommend these:  
*1.* ROC curves and Area Under the Curve explained (https://www.dataschool.io/roc-curves-and-auc-explained/)  
*2.* Learning from Imbalanced Classes (https://www.svds.com/tbt-learning-imbalanced-classes/)
