@channel On the Sprint Challenge Question 2, I accidentally left in the NAND dataset from a previous SC. You will be graded on your perceptron implementation not on the dataset, so ignore the title "XOR Gate" and just focus on the data. For those look for bigger challenge, you can use this dataset:  
```
x1    x2    y  
0    0    0  
0    1    1  
1    1    0  
1    0    1  
```

It was really a great talk, highly recommended to check it out even if you're a non-DS person but just interested in what's current and practical (and what's not so practical) in the land of data.
