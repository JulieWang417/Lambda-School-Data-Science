In writing:  
- Work on the Kaggle challenge, at least getting to fitting and submitting a baseline  
- Iterate and improve, feature engineer, work your way up the leaderboard  
- And/or study linear regression and other topics for the sprint challenge tomorrow  

Quinn [12:46 PM]  
SC tomorrow may ask of you any of the following:  

```- Do train/test split
- Begin with baselines for regression
- Arrange data into X features matrix and y target vector
- Use scikit-learn for linear regression
- Do one-hot encoding
- Scale features
- Get and interpret coefficients of a linear model
- Use regression metrics: MSE, RMSE, MAE, R^2```
