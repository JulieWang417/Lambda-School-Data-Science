@channel Hello!   
Tomorrow (Friday, Sept 26) is Demo Day / Shark Tank Day!    
As you know presenting your work is GREAT practice for interviews, and moreâ€”
That said, we strongly encourage you all to present your project!     
Unlike past Demo Days, we'll have 2 Demo Days running:       
1. Shark Tank Day - 4 groups will be selected, 1 student per team will present at 8:30 am PDT.     
Sharks (judges) will be present and giving feedback. Lab students and other individuals in Lambda School are invited to see your demo.
Sign up using this form: https://airtable.com/shrOnq79OHX9ASW0u     
2. Program-Specific Demo Day - Anyone who wants to present in their section (i.e.: DS4, Web21, iOS9, AND)      
Everyone who submits here will be presenting in their corresponding section.

@here Hey everyone! :blob-wave: Welcome back to some familiar faces, and to everyone joining us for the very first time, welcome to the TL team!! :awesome: We're so excited to get started with you all this week!   
TL training week is an awesome opportunity for you to further your leadership and professional development skills, as well as an opportunity to set you up for success in your TL role! During the week, we'll get you set-up for payroll, go over how to clock in and out, talk through how to hold 1:1s with students, and we'll really focus on building a strong team and sense of community for your students! At the top of this channel, you'll find a google calendar with the schedule for the week.   
As an overview, training largely follows the FT Lambda schedule:  
M-TH:  
8am-9am pst: Pre-class/Warm-up  
9am-11am pst: Guided Project  
11am-12pm pst: Lunch

11am-12pm pst: Lunch  
12pm pst: Cohort meetings with instructors  
And any time spent in training is paid :doge:!  
We record all of the guided projects, so if you have any conflicts with the schedule, please let me know, and we can definitely work with you! (Returning TLs - if you have been through training before and/or are currently actively TLing, you are free to pop in and out as needed!)  
At 8am pst tomorrow, we'll drop a link here with your pre-class materials, and then at 9am pst, we'll drop a Zoom link to get started!
Looking forward to seeing you all tomorrow!!
