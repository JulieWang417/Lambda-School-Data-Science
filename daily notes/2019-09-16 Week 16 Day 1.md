```
article_text = ''

for article in ap.articles[:20]:
  try:
    article.download()
    article.parse()
    article_text += '\n\n' + article.text
  except:
    print('Failed: ' + article.url)
  
article_text = article_text.split('\n\n')
print(article_text[1])
```
^ later on I rejoin the article text with `article_text = '  '.join(article_text)`

@channel Morning! TOMORROW, Tuesday, September 17th at 11am PT, we have an awesome Alumni Brown Bag with @Katy Hollobaugh! Katy joined Lambda School for  :cs14_red: and later on, she became an SL for :cs17:   
Bio: Katy lives in East Lansing, Michigan. She is a Full Stack Developer at Kunz, Leigh & Associates, where she interned for three months before joining the team in a full-time capacity earlier this year. Katy will share her insights on interviews, salary negotiations, networking, and life post-Lambda School. If you're just starting/in the middle of the job hunt, this might be the Brown Bag for you/we'll have lots of time for Q&A.  
I'll drop a link in the channel tomorrow - hope you can join!
