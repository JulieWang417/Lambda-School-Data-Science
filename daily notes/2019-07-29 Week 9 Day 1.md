2. What are you most passionate about/best at in your current field?  
3. What soft skills have been most helpful/relevant to you as you have learned skills for your current field?  
4. What are you most excited for next? Focus on the things that add value to others- you might be most excited for your first paycheck, but pick one or two things that you would want to hear from a candidate you were interested in hiring for your team.
