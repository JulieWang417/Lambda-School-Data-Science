@here Hey all, I just want to break down the ramifications of the 4 week units for you all.  

You've run 1 unit at 5 weeks - the remaining units will be 4 weeks each. This means that overall you will run 1 week "longer", specifically the week you're doing right now. And the last two units are Labs CE, which are meant to support/structure you during a job search regardless (as we said, it's not about graduation - it's about getting a job!)  

Also, we're working on developing a new unit (Scala/Big Data) that will replace the hash table/graphs/architecture CS material for you all, and will be run in October. More details will be landing in August.
