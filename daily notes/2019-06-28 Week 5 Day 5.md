@channel *Unit 2 is Predictive Modeling!*  

I like Brandon Rohrer’s explanation in his blog post, “What questions can machine learning answer?” (https://brohrer.github.io/five_questions_data_science_answers.html).

We’ll focus on two of these questions in Unit 2. These are both types of “supervised learning.”  
- “Is this A or B?” (Classification)  
- “How Much / How Many?” (Regression)  

In four weeks, you’ll do four supervised learning projects with “tabular data” (data in tables, like a spreadsheet).  
- Predict New York City apartment rents  
- Predict which water pumps in Tanzania need repairs  
- Predict the prices suppliers will quote Caterpillar for industrial parts  
- Choose your own labeled, tabular dataset, train a predictive model, and publish a blog post or web app with visualizations to explain your model!

Here are just a few example projects from our most recent cohorts:  
- DS4, Stephen (https://movie-money.herokuapp.com/)  
- DS4, Kim (https://medium.com/@ShadyLaine/chance-me-31b1b88d9067)  
- DS3, Patricia (https://medium.com/@pbradshaw/exploring-the-tanzanian-water-crisis-aa3532192fdd)  
- DS3, Michael (https://towardsdatascience.com/maximizing-scarce-maintenance-resources-with-data-8f3491133050?sk=54e16f4c36cf473872947885fec6c75b)

To help inspire and prepare you, I recommend you look at these links during your summer break, about some of the tools and techniques you’ll learn during the unit:

- A visual introduction to machine learning (http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/)  
- Python Data Science Handbook, Chapter 5.2, Introducing Scikit-Learn  
(https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/05.02-introducing-scikit-learn.html)  
- Plotly Dash, 20 minute video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Cw4JumJTwo)  

Thanks, I’m so excited to get started on July 8!

Lambda School Data Science - Guest Lecture, Aleks Taranov - Interactive Data Visualization

@here Ahead of the brown bag with Aleks, we've got data and instructions for setting up an environment to follow along: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Aq3f9LenVD8g9LvJJF1IEoo1-wlWqPb5

```I've made a yml file that will set up the env with conda and the terminal command to set it up is as follows:

conda env create -f guest_lecture.yml -n choose_env_name

I've also included some datasets and a plotly cheat sheet.```
