basically, traditionally we apply filters to images to extract or to transform features

**Walkie Talkie**  

Quinn:lambda-pm: 10:00
@channel https://lambdaschool.zoom.us/j/8593527401 your last walkie talkie!
```
1. tell us a story of a challenge from your last job
2. what did this anecdote teach you?
3. did this anecdote change you as a person
4. how might this anecdote have gone differently?
5. in hindsight, could you specifically have improved the outcome?
```
in your groups, please workshop 2-3 different stories. if you think you can sell it as something from a hobby rather than a job, go for it. it doesn't have to be your most recent job, it can be any job you've had over the years.
